Fault Injection Tcl Implementation

These Tcl scripts implement the fault injection method.
You need to change some paths in files that reference functions from other files. Particularly in the "source" Tcl commands.

To run fault injection or measuring benchmark duration, script.tcl has been setup as an example.

Currently, setting the timer period doesnt work. Fix soon.
